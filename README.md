# enzuru

Currently on GitHub, I maintain a few interesting repos:

- A fork of [Lispy](https://github.com/enzuru/lispy) that I keep updated until the original author returns
- My [.emacs.d](https://github.com/enzuru/.emacs.d), a maximalist Emacs config tracking the latest trends
- [native-comp-elisp-benchmarks](https://github.com/enzuru/native-comp-elisp-benchmarks) where people can submit Emacs benchmarks

## The GNU Project: 2021-2025

From 2021-2025, I primarily contributed to the Lisp ecosystem of the [GNU operating system](https://gnu.org). I fixed bugs in [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/), and wrote Lisp packages including:

- [company-spell](https://github.com/enzuru/company-spell): A minimalist hackable framework for spellchecking
- [completing-read-sly](https://github.com/enzuru/completing-read-sly): Search symbols defined in a Common Lisp image
- [completing-read-cider](https://github.com/enzuru/completing-read-cider): Search symbols defined in a Clojure image
- [completing-read-geiser](https://github.com/enzuru/completing-read-geiser): Search symbols defined in a Scheme image
- [stumpwm-pianobar](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm-contrib/tree/master/modeline/pianobar): A StumpWM package for displaying a Pianobar song in your modeline

I documented how to use the Lisp programming environment on the GNU operating system with my [Lisp user space](https://github.com/enzuru/lisp-user-space) project.

## The GNOME Project: 2025-Present

From 2025 onwards, I have moved my efforts from the GNU Project to the [GNOME Project](https://gnome.org) and its ecosystem, preferring to write my contributions in the [Vala programming language](https://vala.dev/). I did this because I decided contributing to the GNOME Project was the best way to help the greatest amount of people, given the large non-technical user base of the GNOME desktop, in contrast to the esoteric Lisp cult following on GNU.

I continue to prefer Lisp for writing non-graphical applications, and continue to use Emacs as my primary editor and development environment. I use GitHub as the primary forge for my Lisp projects, and the [GNOME GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/enzuru) as the primary forge for my contributions to GNOME and its ecosystem.
