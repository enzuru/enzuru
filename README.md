# Come join the GNU revolution and use a Lisp-based operating system a decade ahead of anything else!

I am currently working on the [GNU operating system](https://www.gnu.org/) in order to create the ultimate Lisp-based workstation, tied together by the [Guix System](https://guix.gnu.org) GNU/Linux distribution. The backend (operating system) is defined in Scheme Lisp and the frontend (desktop environment) and its tools are defined in Emacs Lisp. I write most of my personal programs in Common Lisp.

Are you interested in having a Lisp-based workstation? I keep my configurations public as a learning tool!

- Install the [Guix System GNU/Linux distribution](https://guix.gnu.org)
- Modify my [Scheme code](https://github.com/enzuru/guix-profiles) and run them to setup your own user
- Log into the user and you will be booted into the [exwm window manager](https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm)
